    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
        This project is part of a thesis exploring the application of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> in the music industry,
        focusing on the generation of music that blends traditional Greek folk elements with classical techniques.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The app provides two distinct music generation modes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule-Based Generation:</strong> Utilizes handcrafted musical rules and patterns inspired by Greek folk music and the style of Manos Hatzidakis to create compositions.</li>
        <li><strong>LSTM Neural Network Generation:</strong> Employs a trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model enhanced with musical rules to generate music sequences that reflect the unique characteristics of Greek music.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Integration of traditional Greek musical motifs, harmonic progressions, rhythmic structures, and modal scales into AI-generated music.</li>
        <li>Hybrid approach combining deep learning with rule-based constraints to guide music generation.</li>
        <li>User-friendly web interface for selecting generation mode, tempo, key, length, and instruments.</li>
        <li>Real-time audio playback and download options for generated music in MP3 and MIDI formats.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage Notes</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> In the LSTM model mode, only one instrument can be selected due to model limitations.
    </p>
    <h2>About the Thesis</h2>
    <p>
        This work is part of a master's thesis investigating the role of AI in transforming music creation and production.
        It aims to demonstrate how AI can be used to preserve and innovate within traditional music styles, specifically Greek folk music.
